My professional hobby is doing interesting projects, mostly related to programming, the web and my workflow.

I write web apps, services, themes, tools and a lot more, using Python and Clojure and sometimes PHP or even Ruby.

I constantly look for ways to work smarter with better software and an array of AppleScripts to do tasks ranging from maintenance jobs to changing my desktop background.

How to contact me:

 1. Enter a [Python REPL](http://shell.appspot.com/)
 2. Paste this

        'crcvwaqribf@tznvy.pbz'.encode('rot13')

 3. Press enter
 4. Copy my mail address from the resulting line to your mail applications' 'To' field
 5. I think you can handle the rest...
