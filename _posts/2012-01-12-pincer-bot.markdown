I don't exactly remember how I made the claw in the video earlier, but I've made a new one for you, so you can play with it.

The claw can be mounted on the front side of the Rover from the NXT 2.0

You can use this claw with the gamepad code from my previous post, but maybe you can mount the ultrasonic sensor and program it to fetch you a drink?
