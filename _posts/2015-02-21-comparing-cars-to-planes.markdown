I was thinking about two of my favourite programming languages. While I think that the one is a better language, I keep coming back to the other for a lot of tasks.

### The car

Cars get you very quickly to your short to medium distance destination. They are quick to start up and quick to turn around.

Cars are firmly rooted in the ground environment. They give you access to a lot of infrastructure, but you’ll have to deal with all the road signs and crossings(accidental complexity).

Cars are kind of awkward for going really fast, or really far. There are JIT cars and touring frameworks, but they only get you so far.

### The plane

Planes on the other hand, are a lot faster and full of advanced technology. Flying is also super fun.

But planes have a slow startup time. You have to submit a flight plan, warm the engine, and wait for the runway to clear, before you can fly.

The controls of a plane are slightly more difficult than the car, but there aren’t any obstacles(Not easy, but simple).

Planes live in this dual world. They can drive on the ground and use the infrastructure, but it’s really kind of awkward to drive your plane.

The [in-air infrastructure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSuBiVHLPYo) is mind—blowing, but sometimes you need to land to get stuff done.

### Conclusion

Like most people, I take the car more often than the plane. But for long journeys, the plane is definitely superior.
