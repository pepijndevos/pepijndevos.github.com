<p>If you where expecting the second part of my bookshelf, hang on, it's nearly done.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a few friends set up a Minecraft server, and I joined them to dig some holes and build a house.</p>

<p>A neat thing with Minecraft is that you can make your own skin, only, it doesn't really look like something when you open it in Photoshop.</p>

<p>There are a few skin editors floating around the web, but nothing with the power of Photoshop. So as a programmer, I decided to craft my own viewer, rather than installing some weird piece of software.</p>
<p>What you see here is a piece of CSS that uses transforms and background-position(tiles) to show me a preview of my new skin. Thus, my workflow consisted of editing, saving, refreshing and more editing.</p>

<p>Recent versions of Safari, Chrome and Firefox should be able to preview you own skins.</p>
