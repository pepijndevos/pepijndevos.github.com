I wanted to invite someone over to watch a movie, but realised that my energy saving light bulb isn't the most cozy environment ever. The light they give of always feels a bit cold.

To remedy this I went to the store to buy some candles (and forgot to buy matches). But just plain candles seemed so boring, so I wanted to do something special with them.

I remembered from years back this Tai Chi practice where you put glasses of water or candles on your hands and rotate them over and under your shoulder. It creates this beautiful spiral movement. So I thought it would be nice to make a robot that moves my candles around.

The robot is done. Now to wait for the movie.
