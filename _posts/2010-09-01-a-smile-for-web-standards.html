<p>We all love web standards. While I was implementing a little easter egg(which are also very lovable) on&nbsp;<a href="http://coverontwerp.nl/">http://coverontwerp.nl/</a> with a good deal of CSS3 love, I thought it would be nice to turn as many clicks as possible into a smile for web standards, a mini ACID test if you will.</p>
<p>Bellow you'll find a CSS snippet that, when included on your site, will flash a smile for every link clicked in a supporting browser. &nbsp;It is totally unobtrusive, and only blinks the moment anyone clicks a link, thus spreading some positive feelings to all supporters of web standards.</p>
<p>Example implementations can be found <a href="#">here</a> and on&nbsp;<a href="http://coverontwerp.nl/">http://coverontwerp.nl/</a>. Show some standards love, by including the snippet below on your site!</p>
<div><script src="https://gist.github.com/561255.js"></script></div>
<p>Other selectors, styling and ASCII arts are encouraged!</p>
