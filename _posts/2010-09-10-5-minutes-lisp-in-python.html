I love both Python and Clojure, so after I read&nbsp;<a href="http://gist.github.com/562017">this gist about a Lisp in Ruby</a>, I decided to craft my own in Python.<p /><div>The idea is basically to abuse a few Python functions, namely Generators, Decorators and grouping to have a syntax that looks like Lisp with yield at the start of every statement.</div><p /><div>It's all still Python, so you can mix and mach however you like, I sneaked a List Comprehension in the example, which fits the Lisp syntax quite well.</div><p /><div>At the moment of writing, the Gist below is also&nbsp;<a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1678367">#3 on HackerNews</a>.</div><p /><div>
{% highlight python %}
{% include code/573397/lisp.py %}
{% endhighlight %}</div>
