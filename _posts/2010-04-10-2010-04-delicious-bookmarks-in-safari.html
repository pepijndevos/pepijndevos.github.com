I recently started using <a href="http://delicious.com/pepijndevos">Delicious</a>, and while they have a nice Firefox plugin and a bunch of bookmarklets, there is no easy way to get Delicious bookmarks into the Safari bookmarks bar.

To get this done I wrote an Applescript with a little piece of Python to get Delicious bookmarks right in Safari. Here is how it looks:

Here is how to do it:
<ol>
	<li>Get the 2 scripts below and save them to a suitable location. You might want to place it in ~/Library/Scripts/Applications/Safari</li>
	<li>Edit the Applescript with the location of the Python script and the URL of your Delicious feed.</li>
	<li>Run the Applescript.</li>
	<li>Drag the resulting bookmarks folder or its content anywhere you want.</li>
</ol>
This will work for any RSS and maybe even Atom feed, you could even bookmark the feed of your Twitter account, for... *hum* easy access to individual tweets.

This is the Python code:
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>import feedparser
print &quot;&lt;dl&gt;&quot;
for e in feedparser.parse( &quot;http://feeds.delicious.com/v2/rss/pepijndevos&quot; ).entries:
    print '&lt;dt&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;%s&quot;&gt;%s&lt;/dt&gt;' % (e.link, e.title.encode('ascii','ignore'))
print &quot;&lt;/dl&gt;&quot;</pre></div>
</div>

Don't ask me why, but Safari needs broken html to import. Maybe because it is meant to import IE bookmarks? Anyway, this is the Applescript, the real thing:
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>do shell script &quot;python ~/bin/feed2html.py &gt; ~/Documents/delicious.html&quot;
tell application &quot;Safari&quot;
        activate
        tell application &quot;System Events&quot;
                tell application process &quot;Safari&quot;
                        click menu item &quot;Import Bookmarks…&quot; of menu &quot;File&quot; of menu bar item &quot;File&quot; of menu bar 1
                        keystroke &quot;g&quot; using {shift down, command down}
                        keystroke &quot;~/Documents/delicious.html&quot;
                        keystroke return
                        keystroke return
                end tell
        end tell
end tell</pre></div>
</div>
