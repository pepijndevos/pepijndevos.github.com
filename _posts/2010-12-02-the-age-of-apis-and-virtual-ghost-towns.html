Nowadays almost any self-respecting site seems to have an API. What can you do with all this data?<p /><div><ul class="MailOutline"><li>Clients</li><li>Analytics</li><li>Aggregation</li><li>And... a clone? &nbsp;Sure!</li></ul></div><p /><div>I was thinking it'd be fun to do a Reddit clone, and experiment with different voting systems. Point is, there are quite a few of them, so how am I going to get users? Answer: I don't need users!</div><p /><div>I took&nbsp;<a href="http://pepijndevos.nl/crowd-sourced-news-with-clojure">this</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bestinclass.dk/index.clj/2010/02/reddit-clone-in-10-minutes-and-91-lines-of-clojure.html">this</a>, and in a few hours(mostly spent updating the work of Lau), I had an&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/pepijndevos/cloneit">autonomous Reddit clone running of the Twitter API</a>,&nbsp;and I believe it to be possible to create a complete social network that runs without any user input.</div><p /><div><img src="/images/Screen_shot_2010-12-02_at_3.01.png" alt="The age of APIs ... and virtual ghost towns?" /></div>
