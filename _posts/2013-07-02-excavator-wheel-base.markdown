Today I took out the RCX and made a wheelbase for the NXT excavator arm I made earlier.

I am satisfied with the look and maneuverability, the only problem remains where to put the RCX. Maybe I can put both the NXT and the RCX on the arm, or make some room in the wheelbase.

It will also be interesting to control the whole maschine. The NXT and RCX can't really talk to each other, but both can talk to the computer over Bluetooth and Infrared respectivly. So maybe I wil make a command centre on the computer to control both devices.
