With PyMouse this would never have happened. Don't risk your date, get PyMouse right now at its <a href="http://github.com/pepijndevos/PyMouse">GitHub page</a>!

All that it takes to wiggle your pointer with PyMouse is this:
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>from pymouse import PyMouse
from time import sleep
from random import randint

m = PyMouse()
w, h = m.screen_size()
while True:
    try:
        m.move(randint(0, w), randint(0, h))
        sleep(20)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print &quot;Goodby!&quot;
        break</pre></div>
</div>
