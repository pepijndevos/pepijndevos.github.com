<p>I love to try out things on the REPL(read eval print loop) before I write scripts with them. The trouble with Twisted is that everything returns deferreds, and after your start the reactor, you can&rsquo;t do anything anymore.</p>

<p>All this is solved by this one single command. It gives you a REPL <em>powered by</em> the Twisted event loop. To make things even better: It prints the value of a deferred once it is finished!</p>

<p>Added hint: Put this in a file, do &ldquo;chmod +x&rdquo; on it and put it on your $PATH.</p>
