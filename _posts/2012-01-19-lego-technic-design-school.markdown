I found some lost and forgotten Lego building lessons. I think you'll love them.

Over at Lugnet, in an old thread, someone asked for tips and tricks about studless building(using smooth beams rather than the classic Lego bricks). Someone linked him to the "LEGO TECHNIC Design School", which sounded really good, but unfortunately, the links where dead.

I searched, and searched, but LEGO just seems to have removed them. Are they to good for this world? Finally, I found them using the <a href="http://www.archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>. Enjoy!

Unfortunately, a few images are missing, but it's still interesting to read.
<h3>Diagonal Connections</h3>
One thing they teach that I have not seen "in the wild" much are all sorts of diagonal connections, like this 1:2 gear ratio and right-angle connection.

It is possible to build all integer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_triangle#Examples">Pythagorean triangles</a>, although few of them are practical.

It might at first be confusing to build a triangle with sides of 3, 4 and 5 in length using beams of 4, 5 and 6 of length, but think of it like this:

What would be the length of a dot? Zero, right? So when talking about LEGO units, a beam with one hole also has a length of zero. Start counting at zero, and it'll all make sense.
