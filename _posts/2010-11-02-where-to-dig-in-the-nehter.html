<p>Spoiler: Don't</p>
<div>You remember my&nbsp;<a href="http://pepijndevos.nl/where-to-dig-in-minecraft">other Minecraft post</a>? A lot happened since then.&nbsp;Victor Engmark took my hack and&nbsp;<a href="http://github.com/l0b0/mian">made a nice tool out of it</a>&nbsp;that runs way faster as well! Notch released the&nbsp;<a href="http://minecraft.net/boo/">Halloween update</a>&nbsp;with a new world that is at the moment called The Nether. And last but not least, I ported Mian to Clojure to form&nbsp;<a href="http://github.com/pepijndevos/Clomian">Clomian</a>, to compare it to the Python version and to analyze The Nether.</div>
<p />
<div>There are still some issues with the code, and I might actually have found my first bug that is actually in Clojure and not in my code. Therefore I will talk and compare in another post, and for now just show you the results.</div>
<p />
<div>The bug:</div>

<div><script src="https://gist.github.com/659491.js"></script></div>
<p />
<div>The graphs:</div>

<div><img src="/images/graph.png" alt="Where to dig in The Nether" /><img src="/images/graph-low.png" alt="Where to dig in The Nether" /></div>
<p />
<div>As you can see The Nether is an unfriendly place with nothing but Bloodstone, Lava, Fire and Mushrooms.</div>
<p />
<div>Unlike the normal world, The Nether is 100% enclosed by Bedrock and in the middle, half of everything is still Bloodstone.</div>
<p />
<div>Unlike the normal world, there aren't any minerals and there isn't a clear distinction between above and below.</div>
<p />
<div>The only valuables I see are mushrooms and Lightstone, and these are somewhat uncommon and scattered across the whole level.</div>
<p />
<div><strong>Conclusion:</strong></div>
<p />
<div>The Nether is an interesting world, but it's not worth getting killed for, unless you desperately need any of those special blocks or shrooms.</div>
