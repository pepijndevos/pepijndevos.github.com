This is my response to the EU/Microsoft browser ballot screen. Honestly, most people don't even know what their browser is, what do you think the difference in IE market share will be?

<a href="http://xkcd.com/627/">http://xkcd.com/627/</a> also applies here.

I recommend any of the five except IE. In case you're wondering, I'm using Safari.
