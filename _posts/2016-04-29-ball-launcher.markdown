My friends studying Industrial Design are currently doing a "smart product" project where they have to make an active 2-player game out of LEGO using the NXT and a launcher of some sort.

If I had to make such a game, I'd probably make a Twister robot that carefully calculates impossible positions and shoots at you while you're struggling. Sounds fun, right?

But I don't have to make such a game, so I can just have some fun making a launcher.
