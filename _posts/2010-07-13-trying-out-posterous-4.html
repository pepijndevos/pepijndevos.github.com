<img src="/images/DSCF2682.jpg" alt="Trying out Posterous" /><p>I received a message via Twitter that Posterous now features Wordpress in its switch campaign. Although I&#39;m in Ireland at the moment, I did not hesitate to try it out!<p />This is just a message sent from Gmail, that will probably end up on several other places thanks to the autoposting feature in Posterous.<p /> I will also attach an image, to see what will happen to it.<p />In the future I might make <a href="http://pepijndevos.nl">pepijndevos.nl</a> the domain for <a href="http://pepijndevos.posterous.com">pepijndevos.posterous.com</a>, and make it my main website, but before I do that, I need to figure out how to port a few features of my old blog to the new Posterous blog.<br /></p>
