Today I spent some time building an excavator. I had to choose between controlling all parts of the arm and letting some parts move together mechanically.

I chose to do the former, which means I don't have any motors left for the chassis, but can freely move all parts of the arm.

Maybe another NXT or RCX kit could serve as the base, which also needs 3 motors: 2 to drive and 1 for the rotating platform.
