<div style="">First of all, thank you very much for your interest and support in PyMouse over the years.</div><p /><div style="">I have some sad news however. There are some outstanding issues and pull requests that need attention, and I haven’t been giving them any recently.</div><p /><div style="">I started PyMouse back in 2009 for making a remote control with my iPod Touch. Since then I haven’t used PyMouse much.</div><p /><div style="">PyMouse was my first big project, and still has the most watchers and forks on Github. I put a lot of energy in figuring out all the platform specific details, and learnt a lot from it.</div><p /><div style="">However, I think the time has come to say goodbye, and hand it over to the community.</div><p /><div style="">I put the project on <a href="http://stillmaintained.com/pepijndevos/PyMouse">stillmaintained.com</a>, and if you are interested in taking over, please send me a message.</div>
