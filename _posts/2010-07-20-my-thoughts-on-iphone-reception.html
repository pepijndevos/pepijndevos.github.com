<div>In the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.apple.com/apple-events/july-2010/">press conference Apple gave on July 16</a>&nbsp;about the iPhone G4 reception issues, they basically said that the 4 or 5 bars you usually see where fake, and caused by a "bug" in the way signal strength is measured.</div><p /><div>If I remember correctly, there was another "bug" with the reception prior to iOS 4, that was solved by a&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_version_history#cite_ref-19">software update "improving" G3 reception.</a></div><p /><div>I can't help thinking they just tweaked their formula to show high bars to save their asses, and this backfired on them with iOS 4.</div>
