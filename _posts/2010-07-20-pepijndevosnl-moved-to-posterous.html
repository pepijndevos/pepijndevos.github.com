<p>After weighting the pros and the cons of moving to Posterous completely, I decided to do it. Wishful Coding has now completely moved to Posterous. <p /> If you see anything broken, drop me a line or try the original blog, which will be available for a while at <a href="http://pepijn.cqhosting.nl">pepijn.cqhosting.nl</a>. <p /> I'd like to thank the awesome people of both Posterous and <a href="http://cqhosting.nl">CQ Hosting</a>(who used to host my Wordpress blog). From the initial export tot the switch of the domain took only a few hours. <p /> The only thing that didn't go as planned are he images in old posts. They where still linked to pepijndevos.nl, which meant that switching the domain would break links. <p /> I asked CQ Hosting to make my old blog available through some sort of address, which they did almost instantly. Now I could replace every instance of pepijndevos.nl with pepijn.cqhosting.nl, and keep all images and links intact. <p /> My beautiful Wordpress Theme is gone for now, but I'll make my own Posterous theme later on. Watch out for some crazy CSS3 and HTML5!</p>
