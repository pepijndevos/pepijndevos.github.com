<p>Since I wrote a&nbsp;<a href="http://pepijndevos.nl/clojure-micro-pattern-matcher">pattern matcher</a>&nbsp;in under 50 lines of code, I do not feel like setting up an entire project for it, but I do want to use it in other projects and share it with you.</p>
<p>Those great folks at Github added git access to Gists a while back, and it turns out you can make Leiningen run in a flat structure with a few extra lines of project.clj.</p>
<p>This allows you to make cute mini projects with git access that can be installed and published and are embeddable and sharable.</p>
<p>Here is the project.clj from my pattern matcher, I also&nbsp;<a href="http://clojars.org/seqex">pushed the jar to clojars</a>.</p>
{% highlight clojure %}
{% include code/946857/project.clj %}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>First we tell Leiningen that our :source-path is the root dir. The other 2 lines are a bit of a hack to make sure only seqex.clj gets into the jar, Otherwise you'll get conflicts and broken jars.</p>
