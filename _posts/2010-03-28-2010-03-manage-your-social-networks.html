I recently had one of my "search for relief" attacks, which means I start to try out a lot of software in search for something better than I already have. This happens a few times a year, and leads to a lot of (remainders of) crap and cool software on my computer.

After I went through the OS(Mac), browser(WebKit), chat(Adium), editor(MacVim) and maybe more, it was time for the <strong>social networks</strong>.

I have now figured out a set of social networks I like, but that led me to a new problem: <strong>management!</strong>

An ideal piece of software would be able to manage at least:
<ul>
	<li>Gmail</li>
	<li>Wordpress</li>
	<li>Twitter</li>
	<li>Facebook</li>
</ul>
And probably also:
<ul>
	<li>Delicious</li>
	<li>Flickr</li>
	<li>Buzz</li>
</ul>
<img src="/images/media_httppepijncqhos_kHshr.png" alt="Manage your social networks" />That ideal application would be <a href="https://mozillalabs.com/raindrop">Raindrop</a>, but there is a small problem, it isn't finished yet. I tried very hard, but it would not work for me at this stage.

<img src="/images/media_httppepijncqhos_BkJJd.jpg" alt="Manage your social networks" />Wait a minute... All those services above are websites, aren't they? So, why not use the browser? Because you'd have to open about ten tabs and handle each service separately... Unless you use <a href="http://www.flock.com/">Flock</a>!

Flock is a browser that is based around FireFox, but with social networks built right in the core. This might be your solution, but it is not mine; I like the speed, simplicity and integration of WebKit(developer version of Safari).

My solution is quite the opposite of Flock. I try to use applications for what they are meant to do, and update as much networks as possible on the way, which in practice means <strong>linking</strong> networks together. Here is my current setup:
<p style="text-align: left;"><img src="/images/media_httppepijncqhos_EdcHC.png" alt="Manage your social networks" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Let me explain that in more detail. A lot of these services include an option to either read or write to Twitter, and for those that do not write to Twitter there is <a href="http://twitterfeed.com/">TwitterFeed</a> to parse RSS feeds into Tweets.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Buzz is kind of redundant, but when you click 'connected sites' under Buzz in Gmail it can dupe your Tweets for those that do use it.</li>
	<li>Facebook is <em>not</em> just another Twitter, so it might need some extra attention, but you can cover wall updates and photos by adding the <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/twitter/">Twitter app</a> and importing your Flickr photos. To do this
<ol>
	<li>Go to your profile</li>
	<li>Click 'Options' and then 'Settings' just above your feed</li>
	<li>Select Flickr</li>
	<li>Figure out the rest</li>
</ol>
</li>
	<li>Flickr can also be used as an Twitter image/video service by adding Twitter as a blog via <a href="http://www.flickr.com/account/blogs/">http://www.flickr.com/account/blogs/</a> and then clicking 'blog this' above any photo. There are numerous Flickr uploaders to use if you want to.</li>
	<li>Wordpress, Delicious, GitHub or any other service with a feed can be linked to your Twitter with <a href="http://twitterfeed.com/">TwitterFeed</a>. You might choose to install additional software to facile operation of Wordpress and Delicious.</li>
	<li>Update: By adding 'http://twitter.com/statuses/user_timeline/&lt;username&gt;<strong></strong>.rss' to TwitterFeed you can publish Twitter to Identi.ca and some other services as well.</li>
</ul>
<img src="/images/media_httppepijncqhos_Ezspy.png" alt="Manage your social networks" />I suggest you browse around my social network a bit and check the 'via' tag to see where the content is coming from. If you are unsure how to connect a certain service, leave a comment, and I'll elaborate on that.

I'm starting to get a little concerned about content duplication, any thoughts about that?
