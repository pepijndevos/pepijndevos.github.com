title: The only good open source software is for software developers

The rest is all inferior clones of commercial software.

When I think of really high-quality open source software, 90% of it are compilers, databases and libraries. Tools for software developers by software developers. There are exceptions (Firefox comes to mind), but as they say, the exception proves the rule.

Outside commercial projects that happen to be open source (Android comes to mind), open source software is largely driven by a "scratch your own itch" mentality. However, this poses a problem when software developers don't have the itch, and people with the itch are not software developers.

I have recently begun to see the world from the perspective of academia and electrical engineering, and it came as a bit of a shock to me how many of the tools that are in common use are bloated commercial Windows GUI software, compared to nimble open source command-line tools I was used to.

Many of them cost hundreds if not thousands of Euros, take up gigabytes of RAM and storage, are a pain to use, and are still the best or only option available. I can only imagine the horrors of working in a non-tech industry.

I don't think there is an easy solution. If I'm solving a problem for someone else, I probably want to get paid. So it seems the only plausible model is commercial software that happens to be open source.

The other option is either teaching people with an itch to code, or make people who code have the itch. Broaden your interests, y'all!!! &lt;/rant&gt;
