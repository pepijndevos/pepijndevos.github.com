First post from the US!

I can't really do nice photography, video and building instructions here, but I did make a robot.

This thing sits under your laptop, and can drive it around and tilt the screen. The idea is that it will always face you, and keep a fixed distance too.

It uses the webcam of my laptop to track my face using OpenCV from Python.

It could also keep a fixed distance using the ultrasonic sensor, but this is not implemented.
