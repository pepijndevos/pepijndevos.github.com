I modified the UBS plotter model to work with the NXT using 2 glidewheels and a normal converter between NXT and classic LEGO connectors.

The original model has two spoke wheels with touch sensors on them, to count the rotations. I replaced these with glidewheels.

Since the UBS is modular, it should be fairly simple to power other models with the same glidewheel-enhanced modules.

I also slightly modified the compressor gear train and paper feed to be more reliable with my old LEGO. Other than that, the model is completely original.

For a nice introduction to the original model, I refer you to Henrik BÃ¦kdahl.
