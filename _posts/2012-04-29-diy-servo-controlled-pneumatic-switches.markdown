Unless you have the materials and the skills, this is not for you. I will use this in a robot I'm working on, but Mindsensors sells <a href="http://www.mindsensors.com/index.php?module=pagemaster&amp;PAGE_user_op=view_page&amp;PAGE_id=141">pre-made versions</a> of the same concept.

What this allows you to do is, using either a RC receiver or a <a href="http://www.mindsensors.com/index.php?module=pagemaster&amp;PAGE_user_op=view_page&amp;PAGE_id=93">NXT servo controller</a>, make pneumatic robots!

These things are relatively easy to make. Materials:
<ul>
	<li>A drilling machine</li>
	<li>A drill of the same size as LEGO pins.</li>
	<li>A small drill for the servo screws.</li>
	<li>A jigsaw</li>
	<li>A pen</li>
	<li>Misc. LEGO parts.</li>
	<li>A small servo with horn and screws.</li>
	<li>Plywood.</li>
</ul>
<div>Instructions:</div>
<ol>
	<li>Saw a rectangle big enough for the switch and the servo.</li>
	<li>Draw a line around the servo, and a dot through the pinholes of the switch.</li>
	<li>Drill out the pinholes, and make an extra hole on the servo outline.</li>
	<li>Open the jigsaw, and put the blade through the hole on the line.</li>
	<li>Close the saw and saw out the servo hole.</li>
	<li>Drill small holes for the servo screws.</li>
	<li>Attach the servo and the switch to the wood with any LEGO at hand.</li>
	<li>Bend a piece of iron wire around the switch and the servo horn.</li>
</ol>
