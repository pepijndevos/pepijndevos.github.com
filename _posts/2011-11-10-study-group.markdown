I'm starting a study group in Loenen (Gelderland), and you are invited. The primary focus of the group will be on programming and computer science.

After having been to several learning institutions, I found out it's not something that works for me. I like to study at my own pace, whatever it is that I want to study.

However, I found that collaborating and peer learning make things a lot more fun. Therefore I want to organize a study group, to learn and create together.

Do you want to join? To work out the details, and to facilitate further discussion, I have created a [wiki][1] and a [mailing list][2].

I sketched out a few things that'd work for me, but if you feel like "I want to join, butâ€¦", speak up, nothing is set in stone.
