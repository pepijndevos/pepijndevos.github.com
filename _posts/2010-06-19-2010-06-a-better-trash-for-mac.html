Different at least...

I bothers me that the Mac Trash leaves hidden .Trash folders everywhere, including external drives. I wrote a few AppleScripts to move all Trash in one place and delete files completely.

If you only want to remove trash from external drives, <a href="http://pepijn.cqhosting.nl/2010/02/automatically-remove-trash-from-usb-sticks/">see my earlier post.</a>

This approach is still far from ideal, but it's interesting and it might inspire someone to do a better job than I did.

The idea is to move files to a sparse image and delete that image when you need to empty the Trash. You can do thisÂ with Disk Utility and a bit of AppleScript.

Now all that remains are the AppleScripts. Save those as Application Bundles named Trash and Delete respectively.
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>property image : POSIX file &quot;/Users/pepijndevos/Trash/Trash.sparseimage&quot; -- edit this
property mount : POSIX file &quot;/Volumes/Trash&quot; -- and this

tell application &quot;Finder&quot;
        if not (exists mount) then
                open image
                delay 5
        end if
        open mount
end tell

on open the_files
        tell application &quot;Finder&quot;
                if not (exists mount) then
                        open image
                        delay 5
                end if
                repeat with the_file in the_files
                        do shell script &quot;mv -f &quot; &amp; quoted form of POSIX path of the_file &amp; &quot; &quot; &amp; quoted form of POSIX path of mount
                end repeat
        end tell
end open</pre></div>
</div>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>on open the_files
        repeat with the_file in the_files
                do shell script &quot;rm -rf &quot; &amp; quoted form of POSIX path of the_file
        end repeat
end open</pre></div>
</div>

Another option of course is to have only the Delete script and a regular folder in your Dock, but that is not half as fun, is it?
