<div>A while back I found&nbsp;<a href="http://www.collegehumor.com/article:1802516">this comic</a>, comparing Safari with a bike, and Firefox with a car with a lot of stuff attached to it.</div><p /><p /><p><img src="/images/collegehumor.82a2a603235eaa0e1.jpeg" alt="Remove the bookmark button in Safari" /></p><p></p><p /><p /><div>But in reality, since Safari 5 supports&nbsp;<a href="http://extensions.apple.com/">extensions</a>, it starts to look more and more like this illustration from a Dutch children book.</div><p /><p /><p><img src="/images/Photo_on_2010-08-20_at_15.17.jpeg" alt="Remove the bookmark button in Safari" /></p><p></p><p /><p /><div>Now that I have lots of goodies and a nice Delicious bookmark button, I wanted to get rid of the bookmark button embedded in the navigation bar. This video shows how to do it.</div><p /><p>[[posterous-content:XUORk3FShLrdFY9GRo7d]]</p><p><p /> If someone knows how to embed the Delicious button in the navigation bar, I would be very pleased.</p>
