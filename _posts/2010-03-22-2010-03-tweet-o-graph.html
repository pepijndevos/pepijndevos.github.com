<img src="/images/media_httppepijncqhos_epdoE.png" alt="Tweet-o-Graph" /><a href="http://metapep.wordpress.com/2009/07/30/get-the-overview-on-what-is-happening-on-twitter-visually/">Back in 2009</a> I made a hackish Python script that would generate a graph like the one shown here from your Twitter account.

It turned out few people are willing to fumble with Python scripts to get 'just an image'. <strong>Luckily, I'm releasing a completely rewritten web app for the same cool idea!</strong>

Now with support for oauth, mentions, retweets, replies, gif, svg, dot, and a lot more.

It is written with Python and web.py, using <a href="http://pepijn.cqhosting.nl/2010/03/install-python-on-shared-host/">this script from my previous post</a>.
