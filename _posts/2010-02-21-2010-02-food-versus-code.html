  <pre>Food: 279kJ/66kcal; E263, E181, E459;
Code: [a-zA-Z0-9]*; hey</pre>


Now, which one is easier to decipher? Do you think we need simple food, simple code, or both?

For the record, the first food part is from coffee, the ingredients are Calcium acetate, Tannin and Beta-cyclodextrine. The first code part is a regex matching any number of alpha-numeric characters, the second part is 'hey' in html entities.
