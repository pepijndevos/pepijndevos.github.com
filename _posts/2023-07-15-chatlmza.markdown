I came across a random [tweet](https://twitter.com/goodside/status/1679358632431853568), found a [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hutter_Prize) and bumped into some smart people and long story short, apparently **compression is equivalent to general intelligence**.

So, how do you build ChatGPT with data compression? What if you compress a large corpus of text to build up the encoding table, then you compress your prompt and append some random data and decompress the random data, and hope it decompresses to something sensible.

It feels vaguely similar to [diffusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_model), but what do I know. Look, this is just a dumb idea, let's just see what happens ok? Well, here is my progress so far. It's kind of whack but it's hilarious to me that it produces something resembling words.

```python
import nltk
import lzma
import random

my_filters = [
    {"id": lzma.FILTER_LZMA2, "preset": 9 | lzma.PRESET_EXTREME},
]
lzc = lzma.LZMACompressor(lzma.FORMAT_RAW, filters=my_filters)

corp = nltk.corpus.reuters.raw().encode()
out1 = lzc.compress(corp)

corp = ' '.join(nltk.corpus.brown.words()).encode()
out2 = lzc.compress(corp)

corp = nltk.corpus.gutenberg.raw().encode()
out3 = lzc.compress(corp)

out_end = lzc.flush()

lzd = lzma.LZMADecompressor(lzma.FORMAT_RAW, filters=my_filters)

lzd.decompress(out1)
lzd.decompress(out2)
lzd.decompress(out3)
# mess around to avoid LZMAError: Corrupt input data
lzd.decompress(out_end[:-344])
# insert prompt????
print(lzd.decompress(random.randbytes(50)).decode(errors="ignore"))
```

Here are a few runs. Note how the start is always `, and tri`, usually completing it into some word. Are we doing some primitive accidental "prompting" or just flushing the buffer? Either way, not bad for mere seconds of "training"!
