On **23-27 May** I plan to gather some of my internet friends at campsite [**Het Appenlnest**](https://hetappelnest.nl/) and that is pretty much the extent of the plan.

### How to sign up

Join the [Telegram group](https://t.me/+X6zMWIetcGs3MTI8) to let me know you're coming. This will also be used for further coordination.

Email [info@hetappelnest.nl](mailto:info@hetappelnest.nl) to let the campsite know you're coming. Make sure to mention my name, the dates, and amount of people & tents & campers. It's entirely possible to stay longer or shorter if you'd like.

### How to get there

Idk, put the address in your navigation or look for a train or bus. If you want to come by public transit [9292](https://9292.nl/) tends to be more reliable than Google Maps within the Netherlands. Big cities nearby are Hengelo and Enschede, which have international trains and Flexibus and such.

Maybe we can coordinate that people who come by car can pick up people form the station or bus stop, TDB.

### What to do

Hang out with friends and do normal camping things. There is nice nature and maybe some museums, we'll see.

I want to stress that there are other people on the campsite so campsite etiquette applies. This is not the place for loud parties, if there is to be any chance at all for a Pepicamp 2025.

### What to bring

Normal camping things.

I'd like to coordinate cooking, details TBD.
