On **23-27 May** I plan to gather some of my internet friends at campsite [**Het Appenlnest**](https://hetappelnest.nl/) and that is pretty much the extent of the plan.

### How to sign up

Join the [Telegram group](https://t.me/+X6zMWIetcGs3MTI8) to let me know you're coming. This will also be used for further coordination.

Email [info@hetappelnest.nl](mailto:info@hetappelnest.nl) to let the campsite know you're coming. Make sure to mention my name, the dates, and amount of people & tents & campers. It's entirely possible to stay longer or shorter if you'd like.

### What does it cost

The [pricing page](https://hetappelnest.nl/camping/tarieven/) of the campsite lists about &euro;20 per tent per night, depending if you want electricity and how many people share a tent.

If you don't own any camping gear, it seems you could buy the essentials for around &euro;70, see below.

### What to bring

Normal camping things. Some essentials:

- [tent](https://www.decathlon.nl/p/kampeertent-voor-2-personen-mh100/_/R-p-303295)
- [sleeping bag](https://www.decathlon.nl/p/slaapzak-voor-kamperen-arpenaz-15/_/R-p-339032) (& pillow)
- [air mattress](https://www.decathlon.nl/p/luchtbed-voor-de-camping-air-basic-70-cm-1-persoon/_/R-p-310045) (& pump)
- mug, plate & cutlery
- toothbrush

And of course whatever else you need for your own comfort and entertainment.

I plan to come by car and pass by Decathlon to buy some campsite cooking equipment.
If you need me to buy you anything, let me know.

### How to get there

The address is

Haarweg 1  
7495 PK Delden

The intercity trains from Schiphol/Amsterdam and Berlin stop in Hengelo, from where you can take a local train to Delden.
From the direction of Brussels you'll want to transfer in Roosendaal or Breda to Zutphen and from there take a local train to Delden.
Flexibus stops in Enschede, from where you can get a train to Hengelo, and then a local train to Delden.

I'd like to coordinate to pick people up by car, but if that doesn't work out for some reason:
From Delden you would take bus 98 in the direction of Almelo and get off at Bushalte De Rustende Jager, Bentelo.
From there it's a 15 minute walk.

I recommend using [9292](https://9292.nl/) for planning bus and train trips within the Netherlands.

### What to do

Hang out with friends and do normal camping things. There is nice nature and maybe some museums, we'll see.

I want to stress that there are other people on the campsite so campsite etiquette applies. This is not the place for loud parties, if there is to be any chance at all for a Pepicamp 2025.

p.s. there is no wishful coding involved, that's just the name of my blog
