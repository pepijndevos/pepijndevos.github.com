With hundreds of blog posts and github repositories, you'd be forgiven for only seeing my most recent work rather than my most interesting work. To remedy this, I will attempt to create a short overview of some interesting projects.

### Self-contained projects

Just some things I did for my own entertainment.

 * [Lib2k](/2023/05/20/lithopedia-part-1-intro-and-clay-experiments.html) a library of clay tablets with media from the last couple of millenia
 * [TCPoke](/TCPoke/) allows you to connect your Game Boy to the Internet and trade Pokemon. It spans everything form custom hardware, z80 assembly, embedded C++, full-stack web development, and a bit of entrepreneurship. 
      * [Bill's Arduino](/2015/02/13/catch-em-all.html) laid the groundwork for Game Link spoofing.
      * [GB Paint](/2016/08/09/game-boy-paint.html) deepened my knowledge about assembly programming and the Game Boy hardware.
      * [Pokemon Go Old](/2016/08/29/pokemon-go-old.html) used that knowledge to make a Pokemon Go clone on the Game Boy.
 * [Bicycle GPS](/2014/11/02/open-hardware-gps-navigator.html) Using a custom file format and lots of optimizations, I was able to render gigabytes of OpenStreetMap data on a kilobyte-sized Arduino Mega.
 * [Dwergmuis](https://www.flickr.com/photos/pepijndevos/sets/72157642384113763) I made my own computer mouse. It's not rocket science, but I'm proud of the result.
 * [Solar System Simulation](/2015/02/05/simulating-the-solar-system.html) A Processing sketch that simulates the solar system based on data form NASA.
 * [Gierzwaluw](https://github.com/pepijndevos/gierzwaluw) A Qt desktop app for sharing files over the local network.
 * [Twemail](http://pepijndevos.nl/twitter-in-your-inbox/index.html) An email server in Twisted that acts as a proxy to the Twitter API.

### Open Source libraries

From time to time I write a library that I think will be useful for other people.

 * [PyMouse](https://github.com/pepijndevos/PyMouse) My most popular and useful open source library, bringing a cross-platform mouse API to Python.
 * [PypRedis](/2014/04/24/redis-pipelining.html) A Redis library for pumping data into Redis really fast. Used in production, but not actively developed.
 * [Begame](/on-the-proccess-of-writing-a-game-engine-in-c/) A 2D game engine in Clojure
 * [perper](http://pepijndevos.nl/2012/07/25/c-persistent-hash-map-with-python-bindings.html) A persistent hash map for Python
 * [ArmageDOM](https://github.com/pepijndevos/ArmageDOM) Clojure DSL for XML
 * And many more...

### Security

Though I'm by no means a security expert, I know a thing or two about some types of vulnerabilities.
So sometimes you stumble upon something odd, like

 * [Fundamentally broken and useless software](/2016/07/10/breaking-the-respondus-lockdown-browser.html)
 * [Odd behavior of online banking tokens](/2015/01/16/31c3-lightning-talk.html)

### Entrepreneurship

The only thing that actually made good money is some old-fashioned software consulting. But I did try various other things such as

 * [Selling clay tablets on Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/shop/Library2000)
 * [Renting IRC servers to companies](/2014/02/16/the-end-team-relay-chat.html), using a fancy deploy automation script and some plugins for various pieces of IRC software.
 * [Selling a BB10 IRC client](/2013/08/17/blackberry-10-irc-client.html) (now free) A native mobile App I wrote in collaboration with [Heris IT](http://www.heris.nl/nl/).
 * [Selling LEGO Mindstorms building instructions](https://pepijndevos.nl/tags.html#studl.es) (Now free)
 * [Selling on Tindie](https://www.tindie.com/stores/pepijndevos/)
